    local customSalary = MySQL.scalar.await('SELECT salary FROM management_payroll WHERE citizenid = ? AND job = ?', {
        player.PlayerData.citizenid,
        job.name
    })
    -- Use custom salary if set, otherwise fall back to default grade payment
    local payment = customSalary or GetJob(job.name).grades[job.grade.level].payment or job.payment
    if payment <= 0 then return end
    if not GetJob(job.name).offDutyPay and not job.onduty then return end

    local account = config.getSocietyAccount(job.name)
    if not account then -- Checks if player is employed by a society
        config.sendPaycheck(player, payment)
        return
    end
    if account < payment then -- Checks if company has enough money to pay society
        Notify(player.PlayerData.source, locale('error.company_too_poor'), 'error')
        return
    end
    config.removeSocietyMoney(job.name, payment)
    config.sendPaycheck(player, payment)
